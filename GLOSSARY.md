# Alea Glossary

This document defines key terms and concepts used throughout the Alea project.

## Core Terms

### Round
A single execution cycle of the randomness generation protocol. Each round produces one random value and is identified by a unique `round_id`. During a round, participating nodes execute the commitment-reveal protocol to collectively generate randomness.

### Committee
A group of entropy worker nodes that participate in a specific round of randomness generation. The committee is responsible for generating and contributing entropy to the system. Each member of the committee performs the commitment-reveal protocol to ensure fair randomness generation.

### Beacon
The central component of the Alea system that maintains the history of generated random values. The beacon is implemented as a Linera microchain contract that records randomness events and provides a verifiable source of randomness to clients. It verifies TEE attestations and maintains the integrity of the randomness generation process.

### Attestation
A cryptographic proof generated by a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) that verifies the correct execution of the entropy aggregation process. An attestation contains evidence that the TEE performed the aggregation according to the specified algorithm without tampering or manipulation.

### TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)
A secure area of a processor that ensures code executes in a secure, isolated environment. In Alea, TEEs are used to aggregate entropy from multiple sources and generate cryptographic attestations proving correct execution. Examples include Intel SGX and AMD SEV.

### Nonce
A number used only once in cryptographic communication. In Alea, nonces are used to ensure that random values are unique and to prevent replay attacks. Each randomness event includes a nonce to guarantee uniqueness of the generated random value.
